In this lesson i'm using provider GCP (Google Cloud Platform) to running Terraform infrastructure on these 5 course. 

I upload the neccessary file, for autogenerate file you can do ```terraform init``` to configure it on local machine. And do ```terraform apply``` to run the server.

Before that, you need change the ```project``` ID to your GCP project that your have been created.

Many lesson i learn, from creating network, instance server, variables and outputs.

this course covers fundamental for Terraform. its so fun and easy cause the course is very straight forward and not much text. 

after learning the basic. i realize this still 5-10% maybe to DevOps but this fundamental. in Future we can create complex infrastructur with this if have some problem to solve. 

Like Private network and Public network routing, then like balancing, Ddos proctection and lastly provisioning with Kubernetes. 

My journey is start here. hopefully can learn many with these.
